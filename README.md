# Rain Prediction in Australia â˜”
This project uses weather data from Kaggle to predict whether it will rain the next day in Australia.  
Models compared: **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**

## Dataset
- [Rain in Australia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and feature selection
- Handling data leakage
- Model training with scikit-learn pipelines
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation using classification reports and confusion matrix

## Key Finding
- `Humidity3pm` was the most important predictor.
- RandomForest outperformed Logistic Regression in recall for predicting rain.
